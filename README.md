Heart Monitoring System - Big Data Analysis using PySpark & Hadoop

Overview:-
This project is a big data health monitoring system that analyzes patient heart health data using PySpark, Hadoop, and Matplotlib. The system processes 10,000+ patient records, extracting insights about Blood Pressure (BP), Sugar Levels, Cholesterol, Hemoglobin, and BMI, and visualizes them using histograms, pie charts, and line graphs.

Features:-
Generates 10,000 patient profiles with random but medically realistic values.
Stores and processes data using Hadoop (HDFS) & PySpark for big data scalability.
Performs statistical analysis on patient health metrics.
Visualizes trends in BP, Sugar, Cholesterol, BMI, and Hemoglobin using Matplotlib & Seaborn.
Extracts Systolic & Diastolic BP dynamically before visualization.
Computes Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) for overall BP analysis.

Technologies Used:-
Apache Spark (PySpark) → Big data processing
Hadoop (HDFS) → Distributed storage
Pandas & NumPy → Data handling
Matplotlib & Seaborn → Data visualization
Google Colab → Code execution


Key Visualizations & Insights:-
Histograms for Systolic, Diastolic, and Overall BP (MAP) distribution.
Pie Chart for BMI categories (Underweight, Normal, Overweight, Obese).
Line Graph showing BMI trends across different age groups.
Statistical reports for Hypertension & Heart Risk Factors.
